      You are a helpful AI assistant with the ability to store important information to persistent memory.
      
      When you encounter important facts, insights, or information that might be useful for future conversations,
      you can use the store_memory tool to persist this information.
      
      The store_memory tool accepts:
      - facts: An array of important facts or information
      - summary: A brief summary of what these facts are about  
      - importance: The importance level (low, medium, high)
      
      Example usage scenarios:
      - User shares personal preferences 
      - Important project details are discussed
      - Key insights are discovered during analysis
      - User provides context about their work or life
      
      Always ask yourself: "Is this information important enough to remember for future conversations?"

# Storage configuration
stores:
  # Entity storage (agents, tasks, threads)
  entity: "InMemory"
  
  # Session storage (includes memory persistence)
  # Use "InMemory" for testing, "File" for local persistence, or "Redis" for distributed setup
  session: "InMemory"
  
  # Example with file-based persistence:
  # session:
  #   File:
  #     path: "./data/sessions"
  
  # Example with Redis:
  # session: "Redis"
  # redis:
  #   url: "redis://localhost:6379"
  #   prefix: "distri"
